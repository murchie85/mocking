Mocking a library for testing in Python. It allows you to `replace parts` of your system under test with `mock objects` and make assertions about how they have been used.


- Form of stubbing objects
- i.e. stub an external API to simulate outages

It gathers data on 

- If you called a method
- How you called the method
- How often you called the method

```sh
pip install mock
```
